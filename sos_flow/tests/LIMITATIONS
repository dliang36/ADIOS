It is important to know that these unit tests are entirely focused on
the performance and memory sanity of libsos routines, used by daemon
and client alike, but explicitly don't test lib->daemon communication
or backplane database issues, and will not reveal problems with
protocols, quality of service, congestion, or any advanced runtime
behavior such as current or future analytics system behavior.

Daemon elements of SOSflow require online testing in an environment as
close as possible to the production setting, in both the size and rate
of value injection. This test suite calls SOS_init(...) with a special
flag SOS_ROLE_OFFLINE_TEST_MODE that allows it to behave normally in
terms of routine API calls, but that does not require or interact with
the SOSflow daemon at all.

To test out the daemon or the backplane/off-node data flow, please see
the test scripts provided in the $SOS_ROOT/examples folder, or the 
$SOS_ROOT/src folder.  :)
