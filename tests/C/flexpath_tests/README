In order to build with sosflow, please add the following option when running ./configure: --with-sosflow=yourSosflowBuildDir.

In order to enable sosflow, please set environment variable SOSFLOW_READ to 1 for reader side and/or SOSFLOW_WRITE to 1 for writer side.

Basic usage and concept of latest SOSflow is documented by the Author here: https://github.com/cdwdirect/sos_flow/blob/master/README.md

To run ADIOS with sosflow on a Linux machine, please first source hosts/linux/setenv.sh. This will set the necessary environment variables, e.g. ports used by sosflow and SOS_ROOT. The db containing results will be in this SOS_ROOT. Bash is the shell needed to run this command.

To start the sosd, please run ./scripts/mpi.start.2 &
Please note that previous dbs in the same directory would be overwritten when this is run.

Now you can go back to ADIOS directory and run the tests.


For current codes, the best way to see the result is run the following query after opening the .db file with sqlite3:
select tblVals.guid, val, time_pack, time_send, name from tblVals join tblData on tblVals.guid = tblData.guid;
We usually pay more attention to time_pack, instead of time_send, and actually avoid to use SOS_publish as the "verbose" since the "send" can be triggered by any SOS_publish using the same pub. So it will be hard to tell who indeed reaches SOS_publish.

sqlite cheat sheet:
(If you would like read the results right in the terminal, you might need this)
aligned by column:
.mode column

show column names:
.header on


Note for future modification: SOSflow seems to have a restriction on name length. So it will be better to pack a string as value and put infos there.
